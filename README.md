# spain_ren_gen_2030
This project consists on the Master Thesis I conducted at Barcelona School of Economics alongside Cristobal Blanco and Tomás Butelman. We create a model to replicate the Spanish electricity market, train it and project its generation capacity to 2030. We evaluate how likely is renewable generation to reach 80% by then using Monte Carlo Simulatons.
